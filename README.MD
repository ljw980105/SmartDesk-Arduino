# Line Follower

Arduino Code for the Smart Desk Project of the IED class at RPI, Fall 2018.

## Notes

* Make sure to install the FastLED and SoftwareSerial libraries
  * In Arduino IDE: Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries
  * Search and install the libraries.
* If you work in CLion, replace #import <FastLED.h> with #import "FastLED/FastLED.h" to gain IDE benefits.
